            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
				Selecting <em>part of</em> a resource on the Web is an ubiquitous action.
				Interactive editing of a resources, highlighting an area on the screen, adding an annotation to a specific point in a resource, or defining a bookmarks to a section of a long document are all examples that involve selection within a resource.
				Over the years several selection techniques have been developed, usually in conjunction with the media type of the resource.
				These include referring to a unique identifier within a resource, defining a time interval for an audio or video track, identifying an element within the DOM tree for an XML source, or using CSS style elements to locate content.
				Many of these approaches are also expressed in terms of a <em>fragment identifiers</em>&nbsp;[[!url]], but that is not always the case.
			</p>

            <p>
				This document does not define any new approach to selection.
				Instead, it relies on existing techniques, providing a <em>common model and syntax</em> to express selections.
				Furthermore, the model also includes a way to <em>combine</em> selections via refinements, a feature that may greatly improve the efficiency of applications relying on complex selections.
				Such a common model makes it easier to provide generic and interoperable tools and APIs to handle selections in various applications.
			</p>

            <p>
				A selection or state, as described in this document, may have its own unique identity in the form of an URL.
				This URL SHOULD be dereferencable and return the selection/state definition itself.
			</p>

            <p class="note">
				Using the URL of the selection definition, instead of the reference to the “complete” resource could be seen as akin to a server side redirection, returning part of a resource.
            </p>

            <p>
				The data model is defined in [[json]], in the form of JSON objects and keys.
				The formal specification and the semantics of these originate from a larger model, namely the Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[!annotation-model]], where it is used to select targets of annotations.
				The current document “extracts” <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> from that data model; by doing so, it makes their usage easier for applications developers whose concerns are not related to annotations. Compared to the Web Annotation Data Model, however, this document <em>adds</em> two new selectors, namely:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selectors</a> can be used to select a full resource, with its a, from a collection of resources, also identified with a URL;</li>
				<li><a href="#MultipleResourceSelector_def">Multiple Resource Selectors</a> can be used to define a range spanning over a series of resources that are part of the same collection of resources.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Both of these new selectors aim the particular requirement of resource collections on the Web, like Web Applications or Web Publications&nbsp;[[wpub]].</p>

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p><em>This section is normative</em></p>
				
				<p>
					Wherever appropriate, this document relies on terminology defined by the note on “Publishing and Linking on the Web”&nbsp;[[!publishing-linking]], including, in particular, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user">user</a>, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user-agent">user agent</a>, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-browser">browser</a>, and <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-address">address</a>.
					Furthermore, the document also relies on some additional terms defined by the “Web Publication”&nbsp;[[wpub]], including a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wpub/index.html#dfn-url" class="externalDFN">URL</a>.

					<dd>A <a>Resource</a> that MUST be identified by a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wpub/index.html#dfn-url">URL</a>, as described in the Web Architecture [[webarch]]. Web Resources MAY be dereferencable via their URL.</dd>

					<dt><dfn>Locator</dfn></dt>
					<dd>A <a>Resource</a> that serves as a wrapper around the selection of part of another <a>Web Resource</a>. A Locator identifies the relevant Web Resource (the <a>Source</a>) through a <code>source</code> term, and MAY contain other terms to refine the selection.</dd>

					<dt><dfn>Source</dfn></dt>

The valid values for a Property are thus any data type other than object, or an array containing members of that data type if more than one is allowed.</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Relationship|Relationships">Relationship</dfn></dt>
					<dd>In the model sections, the term “Relationship” is used to distinguish those features that refer to other <a>Resources</a>, either by reference to the <a>Resource</a>'s <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wpub/index.html#dfn-url">URL</a> or by including a description of the <a>Resource</a> in the representation. The valid values for a Relationship are: a quoted string containing a URL, an object that has the “id” property, or an array containing either of these if more than one is allowed.</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="type|types|typing">Type</dfn></dt>
					<dd>A feature of a <a>Resource</a> whose valid values are predefined strings (defined in this document) denoting the particular types of <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> or <a data-lt="State">States</a>.</dd>

            <h3>Selectors</h3>

            <p>Selection of part of a <a>Web Resource</a> requires two distinct entities:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
					the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pr-preview/tcole3/wpub/master.html#dfn-url">URL</a> of the overall resource; we will refer to this as the <a>Source</a>.

				</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
				A <dfn>Selector</dfn> object is used to describe how to determine the <a>Segment</a> from within the <a>Source</a> resource.
				The nature of the Selector is dependent on the type of resource, as the methods to describe Segments from various media-types differ. These two entities are encapsulated in a <a>Locator</a>.

            <p>
				<b>Example Use Case:</b> Qitara wants to associate a selection of text in a web page with a slice of a dataset.
				She selects both using her client, and creates Locators with Selectors for both entities before associating them with one another.

                <h3>Fragment Selector</h3>

                <p>
					As the most well understood mechanism for selecting a <a>Segment</a> is to use the fragment part of a URL defined by the representation’s media type, it is useful to allow this as a description mechanism via a Selector.
					This allows existing and future fragment specifications to be used with Locators in a consistent way.
					To be clear about which fragment type is being used, the <a>Selector</a> may refer to the specification that defines it.
				</p>

                <p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Ramona wants to associate part of a video as the description of an image.
					She selects the time range within the video and clicks that it is describing the target.
					Her client then creates the Annotation using a Locator with a FragmentSelector.

                <p>
					One of the most common ways to select elements in the HTML Document Object Model is to use CSS Selectors&nbsp;[[css3-selectors]]. 
					CSS Selectors allow for a wide variety of well supported ways to describe the path to an element in a web page, and thus cover many of the basic use cases for selection. 
					Results are not defined for when a CSS Selector is applied to a representation that does not conform to the Document Object Model.

                <p>
					Another common method of selecting elements and content within a resource that supports the Document Object Model (DOM), such as documents in XML or HTML, is to use an XPath selection [[dom-level-3-xpath]].
					XPath allows a great deal of flexibility when describing the path through the structure to the selected content.
					Results are not defined for when an XPath Selector is applied to a representation that does not conform to the DOM.

					Implementers should note that the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#optional-tags">HTML5 specification</a> allows parsers to add elements into the DOM that are considered to be missing.

					For some use cases it is required to identify a fragment that spans multiple contiguous members of a group of resources (e.g., a subset in order of the resources which comprise a Web Publication&nbsp;[[!wpub]]). 
					A Multi Resource Selection can be used to identify this span by creating an ordered list of Locators.
					Except for the first and the last Locators in the list, intermediate Locators are only used to identify <em>full</em> resources (i.e., they only contain the identification of a <a>Source</a>).
					The selection consists of everything from the beginning of the starting selector in the first Locator, all resources identified by the intermediate Locators in the list (if any), through to the beginning of the ending selector, but not including it.

				<h3>Refinement of Selection</h3>

				<p>
					It may be easier, more reliable, or more accurate to specify the segment of interest of a resource as a selection of a selection, rather than as a selection of the complete resource.
					Particularly for resources that contain other resources, such as various packaging formats, this also allows decomposition of the selection mechanisms when the components do not have unique identifiers. 
					This is accomplished by having selectors chained together, where each refines the results of the previous one.

			<h3>States</h3>

			<p>
				A State describes the intended state of a resource when selected, and thus provides the information needed to retrieve the correct representation of that resource.
				Web resources change over time, and a State might be used to describe how to recover the intended previous version. 
				Web resources also have multiple formats, and a State might equally be used to describe how to retrieve that particular format.
			</p>

			<p>The state aspect of a <a>Web Resource</a> requires two distinct entities:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pr-preview/tcole3/wpub/master.html#dfn-url">URL</a> of the overall resource; this is the same <a>Source</a> as used for Selectors (see <a href="#selectors"></a>). 
				</li>
				<li>the identification for the state of the resource.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				A <dfn>State</dfn> object is used to describe how to determine the state of interest from within the <a>Source</a> resource. These two entities are encapsulated in a <a>Locator</a>.</p>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Example Use Case:</b> Alexandra visualizes data on a web page that changes frequently. Her client records information to allow other clients to hopefully reconstruct the original visualization.

				<h3>Time State</h3>

				<p>
					A Time State resource records the time at which the resource is when the intended selection occurs, typically the time that the resource was created and/or a link to a persistent copy of the current version. 
					The timestamp for the resource could be resolved via the Memento protocol, described in RFC 7089 [[rfc7089]].
				</p>

				<h3>Request Header State</h3>

				<p>
					As there are potentially many representations that can be delivered from a resource with a single URL, and a selection may only apply to one of them, it is important to be able to record the HTTP Request headers that need to be sent to retrieve the correct representation.  
					The HttpRequestState resource maintains a copy of the headers to be replayed when obtaining the representation.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Carla retrieves a PDF representation of a Web resource that can deliver HTML, PDF or plain text and then writes a description about it.

				<div class="note">
					The representation retrieved from the server by the original annotator's client might not be completely determined by request headers alone.
					For example, the IP address of the client might also determine the language of the representation, based on the language of the country the user was present in at the time.
					If the server returns a <code>Content-Location</code> header, then the client might instead use it as the <code>target</code> of the Annotation, rather than the URL that was requested.

				<h3>Refinement of State</h3>

				<p>
					Similar to the <a href="#SelectorRefinement_def">refinement of selection</a>, it may be easier, more reliable or more accurate to specify the appropriate state of the resource as a hierarchy of atomic <a>State</a> resources.
					This is particularly appropriate for representing the combination of a <a>State</a> that reflects an internal transformation along with the results of a State that describes an external request.
					This decomposition is accomplished by having the states chained together in the same way as Selectors.
				</p>

				<p>
					Further, given that the State(s) will likely result in a specific representation, there may be specific <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> that are appropriate for describing the <a>segment</a> of the representation.
					In order to accommodate this, States may also be refined by <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Devina writes a comment about a travel e-book which has many versions available over time, and is available in different formats.

			<h3>Selectors and States as Fragment Identifiers</h3>

			<p>
				Although <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> provide a flexible way of identifying, e.g., a suitable <a>Segment</a> of a Resource, the fact that this is defined through an indirection using a <a>Locator</a> may be an obstacle for some applications. 
			</p>

			<p class="ednote">
				We must add a good example. The original one referred to RDF, which is not relevant in this context.
			</p>

			<p>
				To mitigate this issue, a mapping of <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> on URL fragments&nbsp;[[url]] is defined below. 
				As a result of this mapping the targeted <a>Segment</a>, or the relevant state, is expressed in a single (albeit complex) URL.
				In that URL the <a>Selector</a>, respectively the <a>State</a>, is expressed as a single string and serves as a fragment combined with the URL of the <a>Source</a>. 
				Note that this representation is valid only if the URL for the <a>Source</a> does not contain a fragment identifier of its own (a URL may contain at most one fragment identification).
			</p>

			<p>
				The syntax for mapping a <a>Selector</a>, respectively a <a>State</a>, follows the same, “functional” syntax as used, for example, by the XPointer Framework&nbsp;[[xptr-framework]]:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The fragment uses the <code>selector(…)</code>, respectively the <code>state(…)</code>, functional syntax</li>
				<li>The (comma separated) “parameters” of the functional notation are:
					<ul>
						<li>For the keys <code>refinedBy</code>, <code>startSelector</code>, and <code>endSelector</code> the syntax is <code>key=selector(…)</code>, respectively <code>key=state(…)</code> when appropriate, with the value following, recursively, the same syntax as the full fragment;</li>
						<li>For the key <code>selectors</code> the content is a comma separated list of selectors;</li>
						<li>otherwise the key, and the corresponding value, follows the simple <code>key=value</code> syntax, e.g., <code>type=FragmentSelector</code>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>(see the examples below.)</p>

			<p class="ednote">The reference to the Web Publication Resources should be changed to use the short name of the WP specification, as opposed to the editor's draft like now.</p>

			<p>The values SHOULD be percent encoded&nbsp;[[rfc3986]]; the encoding is a MUST for characters that may make the fragment ambiguous, namely:</p>

			<!-- should be <table class="data"> but the stylesheet has issues.... -->
			<table >
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>character</strong></td>
						<td><strong>code</strong></td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>space</td>
						<td>%20</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><code>=</code></td>
						<td>%3D</td>

			<div class="note">
				<p>
					A fragment identifier is defined for a specific media type. This means that, formally, the fragment identifier syntax and semantics defined in this section should be registered for each media type separately by <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA</a>.
					Until such a registration is done, these fragment identifiers have the potential to conflict with other fragments possibly specified by the media type registrations.
					Consequently, this pattern should only be used when the implementation cannot produce or manage the full representation described above.

					A “✘” sign in the table means that the Selector type is not relevant for that particular media types.
					Conforming implementations SHOULD ignore that particular combination.
				</li>

				<li>
					A “?” means that it is not possible to specify, in general, whether that particular combination is meaningful (e.g., fragment identifiers are defined for specific media types, i.e., specific text media types other than plain text may have fragments defined but they are not listed in the table).
					In other cases the usefulness of such combination is not clear (e.g., Data Position selectors for binary images).
					Conforming implementations MAY implement that particular combination.

			<h3>Changes from Previous Versions</h3>

			<section id="changes_from_wa">
				<h4>Changes from the “Selectors and States” Note</h4>

				<p>
					This document has been derived from the “Selectors and States”&nbsp;[[selectors-states]] Working Group Note, published by the Web Annotation Working Group. 
					That Note is based on the formal specification and the semantics of a separate W3C Recommendation, namely the Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[annotation-model]], where it is used to select targets of annotations. 
					This documents introduces some changes as follows. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>Editorial Changes</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All references to RDF and JSON-LD have been removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						The reference to EPUBCFI in the definition for <a href="#FragmentSelector_def">Fragment Selectors</a> have been removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						References to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/#dfn-class" class="externalDFN">Classes</a> (which, semantically, refer to RDF Classes) have been removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						The term <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/#specific-resources" class="externalDFN">“Specific Resource”</a> has been changed to <a>Locator</a>. (This is just an alias to “Specific Resource”, hence does not change the original semantics.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Some of the examples have been changed.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Non-editorial Changes</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The <a href="#locators"><code>scope</code> relationship</a> has re-introduced. (This relationship is part of the “Web Annotation Data Model”&nbsp;[[annotation-model]] but was not retained in the “Selectors and States”&nbsp;[[selectors-states]] Note.)
					</li>

					<li>
						Two new Selectors have been added, namely
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selectors</a> can be used to select a full resource, with its a, from a collection of resources, also identified with a URL;
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#MultipleResourceSelector_def">Multiple Resource Selectors</a> can be used to define a range spanning over a series of resources that are part of the same collection of resources.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
